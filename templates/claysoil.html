            <h1>About Clay Soil</h1>
            <p> 
                <li><strong>High Nutrient Content:</strong> Clay soil is rich in nutrients that plants need to thrive, including potassium, magnesium, and calcium.</li>
                <li><strong>Moisture Retention:</strong> Its fine particles allow it to hold water more effectively than sandy or loamy soils, reducing the need for frequent watering.</li>
                <li><strong>Dense Structure:</strong> While its density can support strong root systems, it also makes clay soil more challenging to till and aerate.</li>
                <li><strong>Slow Drainage:</strong> Its ability to retain water can lead to slow drainage, potentially causing waterlogging and root rot in plants not suited to these conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Seasonal Changes:</strong> Clay soil tends to be sticky and malleable when wet, but it can harden and crack during dry conditions, affecting plant roots.</li>

            <h2>Recommended Crops</h2>
            <li><strong>Leafy Greens:</strong> Spinach, Swiss chard, and lettuce can tolerate the dense, moist conditions of clay soil.</li>
            <li><strong>Root Vegetables:</strong> Potatoes, carrots, and beets can grow well in clay soil, provided it is well-aerated to allow for root expansion.</li>
            <li><strong>Fruit Trees:</strong> Apple, pear, and cherry trees can adapt to clay soil conditions, benefiting from its moisture retention.</li>
            <li><strong>Shrubs and Perennials:</strong> Roses, asters, and hostas are among the ornamental plants that can thrive in clay soil.</li>
            <li><strong>Wetland Plants:</strong> Willow trees and rushes naturally grow in dense, moist soils and can be ideal for landscaping with clay soil.</li>

            <h2>Cultivation Tips</h2>
            <li><strong>Aeration:</strong> Regularly aerate clay soil to improve drainage and make it easier for roots to penetrate.</li>
            <li><strong>Organic Matter:</strong> Incorporate compost or well-rotted manure to improve soil structure and nutrient content.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Compaction:</strong> Minimize walking on and working with wet clay soil to prevent compaction, which can worsen drainage issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Raised Beds:</strong> Use raised beds to enhance drainage and make it easier to work with plants.</li>
            <li><strong>Proper Watering:</strong> Water plants deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth and reduce waterlogging.</li>
            <li><strong>Mulching:</strong> Apply mulch to conserve moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce weed growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Cover Crops:</strong> Plant cover crops during off-seasons to protect and improve soil structure.</li>
